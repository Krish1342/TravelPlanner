## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters travel preferences (destination, dates, interests, budget, etc.).
2. Agentic AI breaks down the planning into subtasks using autonomous agents.
3. Each agent handles a component — e.g., hotel search, weather check, itinerary creation.
4. Results are aggregated into a final, coherent travel plan.
